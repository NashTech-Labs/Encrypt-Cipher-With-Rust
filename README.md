# Encrypt Cipher With the Rust Programming language
A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption, series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. 
An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. 
In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message.

In this template we are going to encrypt the text by using MD5 and MD4 algorithm with the help of Rust Programming language.

## Run the Code
To Run the code you can clone the code and follow the command:

`cargo run`

You will see the encrypted text in the output.
